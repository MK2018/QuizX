# QuizX
Webapp created during HackTJ2016.

Jeopardy-Style cross device quiz game using HTML5 Websockets. 
Made with <3 and lots of Takis by [Michael Krause](http://www.github.com/mk2018), [Neel Shah](http://www.github.com/veryroomy), and [Sean Le](http://www.github.com/seanle24245) .

Fair warning: Since this was a hackathon-created piece of software, it is likely riddled with bugs. That's all.
